# DEAttentionDTA
DEAttentionDTA is a deep learning which based on dynamic word embeddings and a self-attention mechanism, for predicting protein-target binding affinity.
The raw data can be found at [PDBbind](http://pdbbind.org.cn/) including three datasets: version 2020,core2016 and core2014.
Data preprocessing can be referred to `./precode/`. The processed data is stored in `./data/`.
version 1 has active site information, the version 1 code and result can be found in `./src/`, model can be found in `./src/model/`.
version 2 has no active site information, the version 2 code and result can be found in `./src-v2/`, model can be found in `./src-v2/model/`.
# Requirements
- python 3.9.12

- numpy 1.21.5

- pytorch 1.12.1

- pandas 1.4.3

- sklearn 1.1.2

- tqdm 4.64.0

- numba 0.55.1

- Cuda 11.4.100



You can get the DEAttentionDTA code by:
```
git clone https://github.com/whatamazing1/DEAttentionDTA
```
You can download all environments at once according to the following command
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Training & Testing
Select a version and enter its root directory
```
cd ./src/
```
If you want to train this model, try:
```
python main.py
```
If you want to test the existed model, try:
```
python test.py
```

# Description of results
The v1 train result can be found in `./src/kfold-result.csv`
The v2 train result can be found in `./src-v2/kfold-result.csv`
The test result can be found in `./src/test-result.csv`
The v2 test result can be found in `./src-v2/test-result.csv`
ALL the results files contain three columns, the first column is the ID of the protein, the second column is the real value of affinity, and the third column is the predicted value of this toolã€‚
